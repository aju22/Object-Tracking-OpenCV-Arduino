# Object-Tracking-OpenCV_Arduino


## Description
This project operates a pan-tilt-servo camera bracket by an Arduino to track any object. It uses OpenCV a real time computer vision library, to detect object and the information is relayed onto the Arduino, which control the Servo Motors.
## Masking
A mask is created by the user, by adjusting the sliders that control the HSV ranges to track.
Once mask is set, hit Enter or SpaceBar to lock the mask.
